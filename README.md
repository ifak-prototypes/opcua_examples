# OPC UA Sample Project

## Simple example projects including:

### [client access to server method](./src/MethodsServerSimple)
* client calls a multiply method on the server and prints the result
* advantage: server computing power used for executing the method

### [simple server/client data transmission](./src/DAServerSimple)
* client receives data generated by server
* advantage: server computing power used for generating data

### [client display for server capacity utilisation (cpu/ram/battery)](./src/DAServerData)
* client receives data about server cpu/ram usage and battery status
* data is displayed in a chart (in a [jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter) notebook using [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib))

### [example of communication using self-signed certificate](./src/DAServerSelfSigned)
* client receives data generated by server
* data is verified by client using:
  * signature sent by server along with the data
  * self-signed certificate (generated using OpenSSL)
  * [PyOpenSSL](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl)
